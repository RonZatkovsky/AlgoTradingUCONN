# Notes:
A market order is intended for immediate execution of the order upon arrival at the trading 
venue, at the price that prevails at that moment. In contrast, a limit order only executes if the 
market price is higher than the limit for a sell limit order, or lower than the limit for a buy 
limit order. A stop order, in turn, only becomes active when the market price rises above a 
specified price for a buy stop order, or falls below a specified price for a sell order. A buy 
stop order can be used to limit the losses of short sales. Stop orders may also have limits
